1. Feature Contributions

Since I completed this project solo, I implemented all required features:
* Game Board (game_board.py) - Implemented grid and board drawing logic
* Ghost AI (ghost.py) - Added ghost movement logic and behavior
* Item System (item.py) - Added collectible items and their rendering
* Player Movement (player.py) - Implemented player controls, collision checks, and updating direction


2. Pull Request Workflow

Even though I worked alone, I followed the assigned Git workflow:
* Created separate feature branches
    * feature/game_board
    * feature/ghost
    * feature/item
    * feature/player
* Pushed each branch to GitHub
* Opened a pull request for each feature
* Reviewed and merged each PR into `main`

This simulated a real collaborative workflow, even though I was working solo.


3. Testing
* After merging all features, I ran pytest on the main branch.
* Tests were added to the repository and executed after all features were implemented.


4. Reflection

This project helped me practice
* Working with branches
* Understanding pull requests
* Handling merge workflows
* Structuring code for testability

Even as a solo developer, following this process made version control more organized and realistic.
